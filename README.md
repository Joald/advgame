# advgame
Text-based adventure game parser written for fun to learn the Rust language.

advgame aims to be a fully-fledged text based adventure game "engine". What does it mean? You can write a game in it with next to no knowledge of programming, just as long as you follow the admittedly quite rigid specification to the letter.

List of planned features:
 - File parser - *Basic working version*
 - `ncurses` - based interface for displaying game content - *Basic working version*
 - A way to edit .agf (Adventure Game Format) files that doesn't require encyclopaedic knowledge of the format (and the parser).
 - more ways to interact with the game: stats checks, items etc. - *Next on the list!*

Interested, but don't know anything programming, or Rust? Message me, and I can prepare a working executable for your computer.
