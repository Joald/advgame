- Struct means that all field must be included.
- Enum means that you choose one of the options.
- Even if something is written 'ExactlyLikeThis',
  you still have to write it 'exactly_like_this'.
- usize means that it must be a positive number.
- i32 means that it must be a number between -2^31 and 2^31.
- Vec<X> means you need to put X objects in a [X, X, X] list.

type StatValue = i32;

    id: usize,
    name: String,
    default_value: StatValue,
